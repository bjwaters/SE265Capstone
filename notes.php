//Ben

//Done - reducing searching errors and searching by pay, get nav bar changing properly, can properly edit profiles, search results link to public profiles

//To do :  Fill in search afterward? Keep search history? Admin Area, lockout code + button,

//Week 6 -  Both searches work - work on result output format and tweaking variables - work out back button after click?
            //Searches work both logged in and logged out, no radius, rates search works
//          Login works, log out works - again, work on verification
//          Edit Profile show and saves!
//          Control Panel menu works for 3.5 entries. Continue down the list. Report halfway done
//          Sign up mostly done. check verification later
//          Work on default page (random search results?)
//          Nav bar changed after login/logout. Code appropriate in each index
//          Formatting AFTER functionality
            //Work on formatting of the outputs and clearing the screen properly
