//Ben

//Done - Edit profile looks better. A liittle work on the profiletabs to fit it properly. Adv search looks better.
        //Shuffle page a little better

//To do : Fill in search afterward? More admin area - create admin error sending. Report at lockout?, check the search w/locked profiles (show an extra?)

//Week 7 -  Both searches work - work on result output format and tweaking variables
            //Searches work both logged in and logged out, no radius, rates search works. Just need error checking messages
//x          Edit Profile show and saves!
//x          Control Panel menu works for 4 entries. Continue down the list. Report just needs to go somewhere once it's sent.
// x         Sign up/Sign In mostly done. check verification later
            // Some Basic error messages done
//x          Work on default page (random search results?)
//x          Nav bar changed after login/logout. Code appropriate in each index
//          Formatting AFTER functionality
            //Work on formatting of the outputs and clearing the screen properly
