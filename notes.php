//Ben
//Work on Edit Profile                                  Works - not consecutively. Comments drifting
//Tinkering with profile creation                       Not much data validation yet, make a link
//User adding/checking//account details                 Can add a user, profile created at same time. Need to have edit functions for pw and email
//Searching (profile search) advanced/simple            Got the simple search code in. Need details for dropdowns. Adv search partly done
//reports                                               User-side done.
    //tables - users, profiles, reports
//Admin Stuff                                           Admin area from login. Admin sees invisible profile stuff
//Misc                                                  No logout code yet. Try to find out why some buttons dont work 2x in a row



// This week - Admin area, create admin, look at reports, profile hidden objects, added pictures to profile, genre dropdown in profile
// picture replacing seems stable, basic css to many forms, basic css, streamlining search (genre)

//To do : links on search results to profile page, search by pay. Fill in search afterward. Still try to figure out the repeat problem
