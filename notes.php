        //Fixed null on profile genre, can see unresolved reports in admin area. Search History ok! Video link on public profile. Can create admin
        //Reports resolved properly when checked, pushing login to notlogin if there's no session, search button conditional at public profile,
        //account settings mostly done save validation

//To do : Fill in search afterward? More admin area - create admin error sending. Report at lockout?
//Http5 form validation. City/state in process, might not be complete

//Week 7 -  Both searches work - work on result output format and tweaking variables
            //Searches work both logged in and logged out, no radius, rates search works. Just need error checking messages
//x          Edit Profile show and saves!
//          Control Panel menu works for 4 entries. Continue down the list. Report just needs to go somewhere once it's sent.
// x         Sign up/Sign In mostly done. check verification later
